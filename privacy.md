## Privacy Policy

Updated `17/09/21`

## Introduction

We provide a range of products and services. Some self-hosted and some hosted externally by us or
a third party. When interacting with our products and services you agree to the privacy policy by
simply continuing to use the product/service.

Privacy is one of our core values. Customer privacy makes sure we never release any personal information
about any of our customers to a third party without proper and authorised oversight following correct
protocol. We will not collect information we do not need, nor will we store it or hide that information
from you.

## What information we collect

In order to conduct business we collect and store for a unlimited time the platform used to contact
a sales representative on. This may include (username, account ID, platform). We use this information
in order to contact you and identify you from other customers. We do not share this information unless
legally compelled to do so. We will store your purchase history and license history, including license
actions such as, but not limited to; HWID resets, License resets. We store your purchase history so we
know which products you have brought and ones you haven't. Your customer profile may contain extra
information such as social media accounts or emails you provide us, either to communicate on or for
payments, such as PayPal transaction emails. TimeZone, Likes/Dislikes or type of business you run may also
be collected in order to better meet your wants and needs, as well as to better understand our customer base.

Device information may be collected in anonymised form. We calculate and cryptographically hash your HWID
on device in order to provide HWID locking capabilities, preventing sharing, leaking and rouge partners
covertly stealing your license. The HWID is stored on our license servers indefinitely. We also collect the hostname which may be used for HWID resets. The server IP address is not aggregated or accessible via
default operations. However it may be logged in standard access logs with the purpose of security and protecting
our service from abuse.

Error reporting. We use minimal error reporting, such as crash reports used to identify issues and patch them
in various programs. Crash reports contain the following information:

- Product name
- Product version
- Build ID (unique to you)
- Where the crash occurred (location being what part of the program)
- A strace trace and error message
- Command executed to cause crash (if relevant)

At this time we only implement crash reports and UB (undefined behaviour) reports. All crash reports are
automatically deleted after 30 - 90 days. UB reports contain the same information as crash reports and
adhere to the same data retention policy.

We do not collect any information relating how you use our products. We do not collect personal information
you have no explicitly handed over to us.

## How we use your information

We use your customer profile to link your purchase history and license history together and to verify your
identity in the case of you switching accounts. This allows you to still retain access to your products and
the verification prevents adversaries claiming to be you and stealing your licenses.

We use license logs to better improve our service. HWID resets help us better recommend hosting providers,
identify issues customers are experiencing and gain greater oversight into how our products are being used
and potentially abused. We also use this information to greater improve security measures for customers.

Error reports are minimal in our products, however they help identify bugs and errors which we promptly fix.

We only use your information for legitimate purposes.

## We don't share your information with anyone

Your information is private. We use encryption to keep it secure and organisational protections such as
only allowing the highest ranked employees access. We do not share your data with third parties ever.
We only use in-house or security and privacy vouched products and services to process your information.

We will never hand out your information, even when asked or requested to (when able to by law). We will
stand between you and DMCA claims, keeping your information private unless you decide to dispute. By law
we must provide your contact details over in that case. Check our abuse report policy for more information.

## Automated decision making

We do not use any automated decision making at this current time.

## TLDR

We respect customer privacy and there for do not collect any information we don't need. We do not share
any of your information and we don't store it for longer than we need.

#### Updating Policy Rights

We retain the right to update this policy at anytime for any reason without the express
notification or communication to customers or users of our products and services. It is
the responsibility of the customer/user to stay up to date on changes which we publish in
every product download and in public channels when we are able to. The user can always
request a copy of this policy at any time.
