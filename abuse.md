# Abuse Report Policy & Legal Requests

Last updated: `15/09/2021`

We honour abuse reports when the EULA or AUP is violated. A report
does not always result in a outcome and we can not inform you of
any decision made, nor can we disclose any information regarding our
customers.

Legal requests such as subpoenas will be honoured as long as the legal
request is enforceable in our jurisdiction. We will not honour unjust
requests which we are not legally compelled to do so.

## Transparency

If we are served with a subpoena we will notify you when we are legally
able to. Some cases we may not be able to notify you at all. We will
inform you on what information is handed over (we don't collect any data
we don't need, check "Information We Can Hand Over" for more info).

## Information We Can Hand Over

**Customer privacy** is one of our **core values**. We do not store or collect
any information we do not need for a legitimate purpose. Information we
hold only relates to purchase information: date, payment method, amount,
product etc. And your customer profile; CID, contact information customers
provide us.

Information such as IP addresses are not stored on our servers by default
thus we will not be able to provide them. Hard ware IDs are a cryptographic
hash which protects the user's privacy but at the same time allows to lock
a product to one device without ever knowing any information about said device.
HWIDs will not be provided due to their non personal nor identifiable nature.

## Who Can Send A Abuse Report

Anyone can send a abuse report of a violation relating to the EULA or AUP.
However only law enforcement and government bodies can request customer information
when they have been given a warrant issued by a judge in the correct jurisdiction.

Copyright holders can also submit requests by issuing a DMCA take-down notice.

Customer information will NEVER be handed out unless legally required to do so, and
you (customer) will be notified if we have done so.

## Consumer Rights Abuses

Consumer rights abuses which may include "scams" are not our responsibility to
investigate. Thus such reports are not actionable. However we receive a court
order relating to Consumer Rights Abuses we will honour it and take appropriate
action. We retain the right to honour legal requests of the court even if we have
not explicitly stated a certain action/use etc as against our EULA or AUP.

## Copyright

We honour copyright holders rights and will cooperate with issues regarding;

- Trademark Infringement
- Copyrighted Infringement
- Patent Infringement

In order for the request to be processed you must provide sufficient proof and
information relating to the customer in question in order for user to take action.
We take no liberty in collecting evidence for you. You MUST own the copyright rights
or patent rights and have them registered with the correct copyright office in order
for us to take any action.

We retain the right to suspend or terminate the customer's license for copyright related
infringement. The customer's information will only be handed over if they decide to dispute
the DMCA take-down. Once this occurs we will only honour the order of a judge to take down
the customer's service/license.

## Send Abuse Report

To send a abuse report you must email: `slovakia.services@protonmail.com` and have the subject
set to "Abuse Report". You must provide the kind of request: DMCA, COURT ORDER, SUBPOENA, REPORT
etc in your email and the customer in question. To report a customer provide either their:

- Full version number including their CID
- Build ID
- License Fingerprint
- IP+Port of service (service must be active)

You must provide your jurisdiction (country) and what type of body you are (individual, business,
local police, law enforcement (must identify agency): EUROPOL, IC3, FBI, GCHQ, NCA, FSB, NBI, FISIS etc). None exhaustive list. If you are a copyright rights holder then you must provide your company
name.

## Updating Policy Rights

We retain the right to update this policy at anytime for any reason without the express
notification or communication to customers or users of our products and services. It is
the responsibility of the customer/user to stay upto date on changes which we publish in
every product download and in public channels when we are able to. The user can always
request a copy of this policy at any time.
